Title: Crew Launcher Plugins for Traditional High-Performance Computing
  Clusters
Description: In computationally demanding analysis projects,
  statisticians and data scientists asynchronously
  deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems,
  ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services.
  The 'crew.cluster' package extends the 'mirai'-powered
  'crew' package with worker launcher plugins for traditional
  high-performance computing systems.
  Inspiration also comes from packages 'mirai' by Gao (2023)
