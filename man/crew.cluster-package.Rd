\title{crew.cluster: crew launcher plugins for traditional high-performance
computing clusters}
\description{
In computationally demanding analysis projects,
statisticians and data scientists asynchronously
deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems,
ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services.
The \code{crew.cluster} package extends the
\href{https://github.com/r-lib/mirai}{\code{mirai}}-powered
\href{https://wlandau.github.io}{\code{crew}} package with worker
launcher plugins for traditional
high-performance computing systems.
Inspiration also comes from packages
\href{https://github.com/r-lib/mirai}{\code{mirai}},
\href{https://future.futureverse.org/}{\code{future}},
\href{https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/}{\code{rrq}},
\href{https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/}{\code{clustermq}},
and \href{https://batchtools.mlr-org.com}{\code{batchtools}}.
