\usage{
crew_options_lsf(
  verbose = FALSE,
  command_submit = as.character(Sys.which("bsub")),
  command_terminate = NULL,
  script_directory = tempdir(),
  script_lines = character(0L),
  cwd = getwd(),
  log_output = "/dev/null",
  log_error = "/dev/null",
  memory_gigabytes_limit = NULL,
  memory_gigabytes_required = NULL,
  cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to see console output and error messages
when submitting worker.}

\item{command_submit}{Character of length 1,
file path to the executable to submit a worker job.}

\item{command_terminate}{Deprecated on 2025-08-26 in
\code{crew.cluster} version 0.3.8.9001. No longer needed.}

\item{script_directory}{Character of length 1, directory path to the
job scripts. Just before each job submission, a job script
is created in this folder. Script base names are unique to each
launcher and worker, and the launcher deletes the script when the
worker is manually terminated. \code{tempdir()} is the default, but it
might not work for some systems.
\code{tools::R_user_dir("crew.cluster", which = "cache")}
is another reasonable choice.}

\item{script_lines}{Optional character vector of additional lines to be
added to the job script just after the more common flags.
An example would be \code{script_lines = "module load R"} if your cluster
supports R through an environment module.}

\item{cwd}{Character of length 1, directory to
launch the worker from (as opposed to
the system default). \code{cwd = "/home"} translates to a line of
\verb{#BSUB -cwd /home} in the LSF job script. \code{cwd = getwd()} is the
default, which launches workers from the current working directory.
Set \code{cwd = NULL} to omit this line from the job script.}

\item{log_output}{Character of length 1, file pattern to control
the locations of the LSF worker log files. By default, both standard
output and standard error go to the same file.
\code{log_output = "crew_log_\%J.log"} translates to a line of
\verb{#BSUB -o crew_log_\%J.log} in the LSF job script,
where \verb{\%J} is replaced by the job ID of the worker.
The default is \verb{/dev/null} to omit these logs.
Set \code{log_output = NULL} to omit this line from the job script.}

\item{log_error}{Character of length 1, file pattern for standard
error. \code{log_error = "crew_error_\%J.err"} translates to a line of
\verb{#BSUB -e crew_error_\%J.err} in the LSF job script,
where \verb{\%J} is replaced by the job ID of the worker.
The default is \verb{/dev/null} to omit these logs.
Set \code{log_error = NULL} to omit this line from the job script.}

\item{memory_gigabytes_limit}{Positive numeric scalar, memory
limit in gigabytes of the worker.
\code{memory_gigabytes_limit = 4}
translates to a line of \verb{#BSUB -M 4G}
in the LSF job script.
\code{memory_gigabytes_limit = NULL} omits this line.}

\item{memory_gigabytes_required}{Positive numeric scalar,
memory requirement in gigabytes.
\code{memory_gigabytes_required = 4}
translates to a line of \verb{#BSUB -R 'rusage[mem=4G]'}
in the LSF job script.
\code{memory_gigabytes_required = NULL} omits this line.}

\item{cores}{Optional positive integer scalar,
number of CPU cores for the worker.
\code{cores = 4} translates
to a line of \verb{#BSUB -n 4} in the LSF job script.
\code{cores = NULL} omits this line.}
}
\value{
A classed list of options.

Set options for LSF job management.
