\usage{
crew_options_cluster(
  verbose = FALSE,
  command_submit = as.character(Sys.which("qsub")),
  command_terminate = NULL,
  script_directory = tempdir(),
  script_lines = character(0L)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to see console output and error messages
when submitting worker.}

\item{command_submit}{Character of length 1,
file path to the executable to submit a worker job.}

\item{command_terminate}{Deprecated on 2025-08-26 in
\code{crew.cluster} version 0.3.8.9001. No longer needed.}

\item{script_directory}{Character of length 1, directory path to the
job scripts. Just before each job submission, a job script
is created in this folder. Script base names are unique to each
launcher and worker, and the launcher deletes the script when the
worker is manually terminated. \code{tempdir()} is the default, but it
might not work for some systems.
\code{tools::R_user_dir("crew.cluster", which = "cache")}
is another reasonable choice.}

\item{script_lines}{Optional character vector of additional lines to be
added to the job script just after the more common flags.
An example would be \code{script_lines = "module load R"} if your cluster
supports R through an environment module.}
}
\value{
A classed list of options.
