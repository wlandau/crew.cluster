In computationally demanding analysis projects, statisticians and data scientists asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services. The `crew.cluster` package extends the [`mirai`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai)-powered 'crew' package with worker launcher plugins for traditional high-performance computing systems. Inspiration also comes from packages [`mirai`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai), [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/), [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/), [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), and [`batchtools`](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/).

# Installation

Type | Source | Command
---|---|---
Release | CRAN | `install.packages("crew.cluster")`
Development | GitHub | `remotes::install_github("wlandau/crew.cluster")`
Development | R-universe | `install.packages("crew", repos = "https://wlandau.r-universe.dev")`

# Documentation

Please see <https://wlandau.github.io/crew.cluster/> for documentation, including a full function reference and usage tutorial.

# Usage

First, create a controller object appropriate for your platform. For example, to launch workers on a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) cluster, use `crew_controller_sge()`.

```{r}
library(crew.cluster)
controller <- crew_controller_sge(
  name = "my_workflow", # for informative job names
  workers = 16,
  tasks_max = 2, # to avoid reaching wall time limits
  seconds_idle = 10, # to release resources when they are not needed
  script_lines = "module load R" # if R is an environment module
)
controller$start()
```

At this point, usage is exactly the same as basic [`crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew). The `push()` method submits tasks and auto-scales SGE workers to meet demand.

```{r}
controller$push(name = "do work", command = do_work())
```

The `pop()` method retrieves available tasks.

```{r}
controller$pop()
#> # A tibble: 1 × 11
#>   name         command result seconds   seed error trace warni…¹ launc…² worker insta…³
#>   <chr>        <chr>   <list>   <dbl>  <int> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>    <int> <chr>  
#> 1 do work   … do_work… <int>        0 1.56e8 NA    NA    NA      79e71c…      1 7686b2…
#> # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​warnings, ²​launcher, ³​instance
```

Remember to terminate the controller when you are done.

```{r}
controller$terminate()
```

# Tips

* `crew.cluster` submits jobs over the local network using system calls to the resource manager (e.g SGE or SLURM). Please invoke `crew.cluster` on a node of the cluster, either a login node (head node) or a compute node.
* Most clusters install software like R in versioned environment modules. Most likely, you will need to call `module load R` (or `module load R/x.y.z` for a specific version) in order to use on the cluster. In `crew.cluster`, you will most likely need to supply `"module load R"` or similar to the `script_lines` argument of e.g. `crew_controller_sge()`.

# Risks

The risks of `crew.cluster` are the same as [those of `crew`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/#risks), plus the risks of traditional high-performance computing environments. These distributed systems typically operate inside a firewall and trust the local network. It is your responsibility to assess the security of these systems and use `crew.cluster` in a safe manner. In addition, `crew.cluster` automatically launches jobs on the cluster scheduler, and it may not always be able to terminate leftover jobs. It is your responsibility to monitor your jobs an manually terminate jobs that `crew.cluster` may not be able to.

# Thanks

* [Charlie Gao](https://github.com/shikokuchuo) created [`mirai`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai) and [`nanonext`](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/nanonext) and graciously accommodated the complicated and demanding feature requests that made `crew` and its ecosystem possible.
* Thanks to [Michael Schubert](https://github.com/mschubert) for sharing the [template files](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/tree/master/inst) in [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq) under the permissive [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq/blob/master/LICENSE). These scripts helped construct launcher plugins to clusters where direct access was not possible. See the [`NOTICE`](https://github.com/wlandau/crew.cluster/blob/main/NOTICE) file in this package.
